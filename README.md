# focus

todo:
- use notify instead of reading file repeatedly
- rewrite the whole project as a DNS server for cross-platorm compatibility and a more robust approach to website blocking
- add audio cue when timer starts/ends
- fix weird sound bug when running in background
- add lock/unlock command
- add different modes (aggressive)
- add different blocking lists
- add focus up/down/status
- add better time parsing (now duration is parsed strictly as minutes)
- add event-driven cleanup
- add more robust status checking (sysinfo)
